This repository contains all exercise work done for each week of the course "Functional Programming with Scala" by Martin Odersky, provided through coursera. Each folder W1, W2... represent work done for week 1, week 2, etc.

For each Scala project, code I authored can be found in src folder (containing main and test sub-folders).
